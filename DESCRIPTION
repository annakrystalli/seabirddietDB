Title: Seabird Diet Database
Description: Dataset collated from all known information on prey consumed by seabirds 
  breeding in the British Isles.  We have focused on the 10 most common seabird species 
  by total biomass during the breeding season, accounting for 95% of biomass of seabirds 
  a marine diet in 2000. Thus the prey reflects the majority of marine prey consumed by
  seabirds in British waters.
